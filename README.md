# AI crypto trend model
The AI model compares current positions with a similar historical market position in order to give more insight. 

## Summary
The project focuses on market analysis surrounding current trends in cryptocurrencies and highlighting the currencies that are in a similiar market position it has been in the past based on historical data and also compares market attitydes towards the currency by discussions online as well as coverage in the news.

Selecting one gives users information and data about the current position, which is then compared with historical data and public sentiment from when the currency was in a similar position. This can then be used to make a more informed decision regarding investing in the currency.
 
## Data sources and methods
NLP - neural network for word classification in news etc.
Regression models for comparing historical data with current data and market trends.


## Challenges
Historical data and sentiments only provides a limited view and other variables might play a more significant role.
Potential risk of financial loss in a volatile market. 

## Whats next?
Training the model on large datasets. 
Develop and implement a protype.
Add additional features.
